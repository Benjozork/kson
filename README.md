# kson
a `json` parser with kotlin support, including support for nullable/non-mullable types and more.

## Why
I wanted to use `gson` but it doesn't support kotlin nullability and sets everything to `null` like a caveman

## Features
- (WIP) no unnecessary wrappers, returns primitive types and objects (not for now, I need wrappers for prototyping)
- (WIP) supports kotlin's nullability system
- (WIP) uses annotations to customize parsing
- (WIP) support for custom parsers
